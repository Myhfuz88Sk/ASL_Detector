# ASL_Detector
American Sign Language Detection

Overview

The ASL Detector is a machine learning-based project that aims to recognize and classify American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. This project uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and interpret ASL signs, enabling users to communicate more effectively.

Features

- Real-time ASL gesture recognition
- Classification of ASL signs into different categories (e.g., alphabet, numbers, phrases)
- Support for various input devices (e.g., webcam, video files)
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

Requirements

- Python 
- OpenCV 
- TensorFlow (or other deep learning frameworks)
- NumPy
- Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Myhfuz88Sk/ASL_Detector
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application: python app.py

Usage

1. Launch the application and select the input device (e.g., webcam).
2. Perform ASL gestures in front of the camera.
3. The application will recognize and display the corresponding ASL sign.
